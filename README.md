DESCRIPTION:
This project is a browser-based word search game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The HTML provides the puzzle structure, CSS handles the visual layout and styling of the grid,
and JavaScript generates the word search, checks user selections, and tracks which words have been found.
The game highlights selected letters, marks completed words, and offers an interactive and responsive experience for players.
